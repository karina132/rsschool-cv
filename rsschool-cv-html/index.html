            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              My goal in life is to become an expert in the field I feel happy and reach the top position. 
              Now I am interested in IT and the whole process of creating a product from analysis and development 
              to marketing and sales. I believe that I have the ability to grown up from a junior developer to a 
              leader and an expert in this field.
              <br>
              Changes in technology are rapid these days, but I am ready and want to develop throughout my life. 
              I am flexible by nature and can quickly adapt to changing situations. 
              I am willing to apply new processes and cutting edge technology to achieve goals. 
              My passion for self-improvement and learning new things found reflection in good grades at school and university. 
              I am a person aimed to success and for this reason I willing to always train and upskill, work late and 
              overtime to get a project finished to schedule. I am an advocate for writing best-practice, robust, 
              scalable and tested code.
