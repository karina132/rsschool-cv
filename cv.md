## Summary

My goal in life is to become an expert in the field I feel happy and reach the top position. Now I am interested in IT and the whole process of creating a product from analysis and development to marketing and sales. I believe that I have the ability to grown up from a junior developer to a leader and an expert in this field. 

Changes in technology are rapid these days, but I am ready and want to develop throughout my life. I am flexible by nature and can quickly adapt to changing situations. I am willing to apply new processes and cutting edge technology to achieve goals. My passion for self-improvement and learning new things found reflection in good grades at school and university. I am a person aimed to success and for this reason I willing to always train and upskill, work late and overtime to get a project finished to schedule. I am an advocate for writing best-practice, robust, scalable and tested code.
